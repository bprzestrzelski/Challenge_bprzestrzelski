# Task 1
## Subtask 1
I joined the challenge to learn some new skills and expand my horizons. As I kind of stumbled upon a job in QA as a manual tester, I found an interesting new world of opportunity. I always had a great desire to learn about writing code and working IT, but the self-learning about it always seemed like too daunting of a task. This course seemed like a good way to both learn what I always wanted to learn and expand my career.

Im mostly driven by curiosity, but to be honest there is some financial incentive, in terms that I hope skills picked up during a challenge will aid me in my career. It's hard for me anticipate anything from the course - I just keep my head open for all the new stuff to learn!
